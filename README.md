# CS50-Final-Weatherly

#### Video Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ9CD0ubaFw

#### Description:

Project Weatherly is a universal console tool that provides accurate and timely weather forecasts.

This application was developed using Python as part of the CS50 course.

When the script runs, it greets the user and asks for the city.

The city must be active and existing in any country.

Once entered, the request is processed.

If the city does not exist or is not valid, the request may fail.

Otherwise, the request will be successful and the user will be shown the latest weather information.

After this, the program asks the user if he wants to repeat the steps.

In case of unexpected errors, including request processing, a safe shutdown is provided.

Text is output to the console with a delay to improve the user experience.

This application is a great example of how programming can be used to create useful and effective tools.

Weatherly also demonstrates the importance of error handling in programming.

Errors can occur for various reasons, such as incorrect user input or internet connection issues.

Thanks to error handling, Weatherly can respond correctly to these situations and provide useful feedback to the user.

Overall, Weatherly is a powerful weather information tool that demonstrates the power of Python and the importance of good user interface design.

The project used the libraries:

- **art** - is using for ASCII-art

- **requests** - to process and handling user requests

- **pytest** - for unit testing

#### Usage:

- install all of dependencies, that're listed in `requirements.txt`

- run `py project.py`
